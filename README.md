Emotion Detection

1. Explain your project?
Ans: It involves the concepts from the domains of Natural Language Processing as well as Machine Learning. You can use the trained dataset to detect the emotion of the human being. For detecting the different emotions, first, you need to train those different emotions. For this we will start with using LSTMs, then BiLSTMs and then some more advanced methods. After then we will try to incorporate it in a web-app using flask.

2.Why this project? 
Ans: Emotion Detection aims to detect and recognize types of feelings through the expression of texts, such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Here, we have used it to detect the 4 emotions- happiness,sadness,anger and fear.

3.What are the needs of the project? 
Ans: It only requires student of ML.

4. What is the time of completion of the project? 
Ans: We require about a month for completion of this project.
